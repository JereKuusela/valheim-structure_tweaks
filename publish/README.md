# Structure Tweaks

Minor tweaks to the game logic that allow creating invulnerable structures.

Install on all clients and on the server.

Check any modding [guide](https://youtu.be/WfvA5a5tNHo) if you don't know how.

# Instructions

This mod does two things:

- Objects with more than 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 (1E19) health won't show any damage numbers.
- Pieces without creator won't be directly targeted by the enemies.

On its own, this mod doesn't do anything. You need other mods to create objects with absurdly high amoungs of health or pieces without any creator.

For example [Infinity Hammer](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/Infinity_Hammer/) or [World Edit Commands](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/JereKuusela/World_Edit_Commands/).
